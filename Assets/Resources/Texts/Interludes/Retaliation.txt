You managed to destroy the raider forces within The Empire's territory. Now you must move your soldiers northeast and take out the main raider stronghold to end their attacks once and for all. Some of our border forces have advanced from the east, so you will be able to commit a two-pronged assault. You must hold on to our forward positions while you attack the raider stronghold.
